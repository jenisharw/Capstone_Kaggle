 # Capstone_Kaggle( Home Credit Default Risk)
# Business Problem :
Home Credit aims to alleviate the challenges faced by individuals with limited credit history in accessing loans by utilizing advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to identify creditworthy applicants within this underserved population, promoting financial inclusion. The central problem is the difficulty in extending loans to individuals lacking established credit histories, leading them to potentially exploitative lenders. To address this, Home Credit leverages telco and transactional data to predict loan repayment capabilities, enabling informed decision-making. The project's objective is to create an accurate model that assesses the likelihood of default for specific loans, ultimately increasing the acceptance of deserving clients and fostering financial growth. The project's scope encompasses identifying potential loan defaulters through an in-depth analysis of applicant features.
